# Family-and-Community-Outreach-for-Second-Grade

This tool assists second-grade teachers in using AI models like ChatGPT to generate personalized, adaptable letter templates for communication with families. The content is focused on engaging parents and caregivers in a year-long activity called "Author’s Walkabout."

## Features

This prompt generates:

1. **Introductory Letter**: introduces the "Author’s Walkabout" activity and how parents can support their child's artistic and literary development.

2. **Progress Update Letter**: provides families with an update on their child's progress in the activity.

3. **Event Invitation Letter**: invites families to attend the end-of-year event, with suggestions for interaction during the event.

4. **Appreciation Letter**: thanks families for their attendance and participation, highlighting memorable moments from the event.


## Prompts
```
This year, at Hillbrook School, we are doing this activity: 
Author’s Walkabout (1st/2nd grade) - Throughout the school year, students build collections of original artwork and stories, which they share with parents and peers at the end of the year! 

I need to write a four short, friendly letters to families (parents and caregivers) that I can send throughout the year and I'd like you to create some fillable templates that I can adapt and use:
Letter 1: Introduce the walkabout and how you can support your child this year as they develop their artwork and writing.
Letter 2: Remind families of the ongoing work students are doing and the progress they have made 
Letter 3: Invite families to the event. Suggest ways of interacting with their child and other children during the event.
Letter 4: Thank families for attending. Share any highlights from the event.
```
